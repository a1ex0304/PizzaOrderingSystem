# PizzaOrderingSystem
This project is a Python-based program that simulates a user-friendly Pizza Ordering System. The application allows users to customize their pizza by selecting the size and adding their preferred toppings from a predefined list. Once the order is finalized, the program generates and displays a detailed receipt that includes the user's choices and the total cost of the order. This program effectively utilizes core Python concepts such as loops for iterating through user inputs, functions to modularize the code and handle specific tasks, and string concatenation to create the receipt in a clean and readable format. It offers a practical example of how Python can be used to build an interactive and functional ordering system.
